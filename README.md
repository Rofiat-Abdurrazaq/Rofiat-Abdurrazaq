## Hi there 👋 I'm Rofiat

**About Me**

I’m Rofiat Abdurrazaq, a Data & Operations professional with a strong edge in analytics, digital process optimization, and product thinking.
I specialize in turning chaotic data, ambiguous problems, and inefficient workflows into clarity, structure, and actionable intelligence that teams can use to move faster and make better decisions.

My strength is simple:
I see patterns in data, gaps in processes, and opportunities in systems long before others notice them.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**What I Do**

I help companies transform raw data and fragmented processes into insights, dashboards, and operational systems that actually improve performance.
My work typically includes:
- Building decision-ready dashboards that reduce guesswork
- Turning user pain points into structured product insights
- Mapping business and product workflows to reveal bottlenecks
- Identifying inefficiencies in procurement, operations, or service delivery
- Supporting teams with data-driven prioritization and experimentation

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**My Approach**

- I work with a clarity-first mindset
- Simplify before scaling
- Validate assumptions early
- Build solutions users can actually understand
- Communicate insights in a way decision-makers trust
- I’m big on accuracy, structure, and solving a problem from its root — not just decorating the symptoms.
